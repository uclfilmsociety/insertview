<p id="first-paragraph">Uncut Gems, the Safdie brothers' latest film, is a love letter to
Manhattan's Diamond District and the shysters who run it. It's a homage
to cheaters who make a lot of money and try desperately to juggle their
vices with their families. Fittingly, the film stars Adam Sandler as
Howard Ratner, a jewellery store owner up to his neck in shady business
deals and lies.</p>

The film moves fast. The only constant the audience has to hold on to is
their morally dubious protagonist, who remains in motion. One minute
he's making high money bets on basketball games, the next he's sitting
alongside his teenage son at Passover Seder. He's sleazy and a bit
pathetic, but we can't help rooting for him.

Howard owes money to his loan-shark brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian),
who is convoyed by a pair of seemingly harmless thugs. Howard's plan for
reimbursement is an African black opal stone that he intends to sell at
auction for \$300,000. Instead, pro basketball player Kevin Garnett -
played by himself in a breakout role - has a spiritual connection with
the stone and borrows it. Garnett loans him his Celtic championship ring
as collateral for the "priceless" stone, which Howard pawns in order to
make a big bet on the Celtics game. The rest of the film untangles like
a high stakes roulette game; you don't know what's going to happen, but
you do know that if the Celtics don't win the game, things aren\'t going
to end well for Howard.

Uncut Gems is not easy to watch, so if you're prone to anxiety - proceed
with caution. Alongside the bet, Howard is trying to salvage his
marriage with soon to be ex-wife (Idina Menzel) and focuses all his
sexual frustration toward his mistress (Julia Fox.). In one particularly
bizarre but memorable scene, Howard suspects his mistress of canoodling
with The Weeknd at a club (yes, that The Weeknd), and attacks him before
storming off.

Sandler is beyond good in a role that feels out of character when
compared to his previous work in films like Happy Gilmore and Billy
Madison. Howard is a crook, yes, but we like him because he's an
unabashed optimist, a go-getter, a hard worker who never gives up on his
dream to make a shit ton of cash. The Safdie brothers never criticize
him because of his flaws, and we don't either. Instead, the film makes
us sympathize with the realities of life, in which there are no heroes
or villains. Like the uncut gems that Howard obsesses over, this film is
rough, but also a piece of sheer beauty. If you don't mind two-hour
anxiety attacks and a lot of New York accents screaming over each other,
*Uncut Gems* is definitely worth watching.
