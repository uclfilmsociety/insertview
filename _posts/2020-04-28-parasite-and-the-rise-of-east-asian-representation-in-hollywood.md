<p id="first-paragraph">In recent years, East Asian cinema has taken over the world, with hits
such as <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> and <i>Train to Busan</i> receiving both
commercial and critical acclaim. There is, perhaps, no greater
demonstration of this shift in focus than <i>Parasite</i>'s triumphant Best
Picture win at the 92nd Academy Awards.</p>

Leading up to the awards ceremony, Bong Joon Ho's *Parasite* was the
underdog, with predictions favouring *1917* or *Once Upon a Time in
Hollywood* in lieu of the South Korean thriller. But class struggle, a
lovable scrappy family, and fantastic cinematography made it the perfect
storm. *Parasite* became the first non-English language movie in
cinematic history to win the biggest award of the night, and rightfully
so. However, it didn't just break records --- it also may have truly
changed the way the film industry sees people of East Asian descent.

Historically, Hollywood has been absolutely awful in their depictions of
people of colour on screen. From blackface to casting white people for
Asian roles (Mickey Rooney as Mr. Yunioshi in *Breakfast at Tiffany's*
still makes my soul ache), it seems as though Western filmmaking can
only accept representation if it's on their terms --- an Indian bodega
owner here, a Korean doctor there --- and this trend continues today.
Yet, despite this, large strides have been made thanks to the numerous
Asian films that have solidified themselves into western public
consciousness.

The turn of the century set in motion a period of incredible success for
East Asian filmmaking. *In the Mood for Love, Battle Royale,* and
*Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* were all released in the year 2000,
with the latter being nominated for 10 Academy Awards and winning four
of them. These films became recognizable hits all over the globe and
strongly impacted future movies to come (I, for one, am still not
convinced that the whole dystopian novel/movie craze of the early 2010s
wasn't influenced by *Battle Royale*). Not only were these films great
on their own, but their collective release and subsequent success
demonstrated how diverse and unique Asian-lead storylines could be,
without the need to stereotype or typecast. In addition, the visibility
of their victories changed what Asian filmmakers thought they could
achieve in Hollywood.

Nowadays, we see Asian representation almost everywhere: Steven Yeun's
breakout role on *The Walking Dead*, John Cho's hair-raising thriller
*Searching*, heartwarming romcoms like *Always Be My Maybe* and the *To
All the Boys I've Loved Before* film trilogy (still \#TeamPeter y'all).
Audiences will no longer accept lazy or tokenistic representation
anymore; we want stories that allow all aspects of our humanity to be
told. Slowly, these films are showing that Asian people can be sci-fi
soldiers, rom-com protagonists, and superheroes --- the kind of
portrayals on screen that I dreamed of having as a child. Thanks to
streaming platforms like Youtube, Netflix, and Hulu producing content
without having to go through the red tape of traditional television
networks and production companies, it is easier than ever to have our
voices be heard.

Some people may think that *Parasite*'s sweeping win at the Academy
Awards might just be a fluke, but I disagree. *Parasite* and all the
films that have come before it mark a seismic shift in the way East
Asian people should be represented in the entertainment industry --- not
by making our stories more digestible, but by being unapologetic about
the culture and the people they represent.
