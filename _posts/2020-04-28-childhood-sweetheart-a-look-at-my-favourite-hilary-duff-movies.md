<p id="first-paragraph">Hilary Duff has played a central role in my life since I was a child.
All I wanted was to live in a small suburban town and wear bandannas and pom-pom scrunchies in my hair like her and Lalaine in <i>Lizzie McGuire</i>. When I think back to which mid-2000s celebrity's oeuvre I hold the most dear to my heart, the magical work of the Duff reigns supreme. Below, I share four of my favourite Duff films and the lasting impact they have had on me.</p>

## Raise Your Voice

We begin with the 2004 box-office bomb, *Raise Your Voice*. Full of
cringe-inducing musical performances and first kisses, this film is the
perfect introduction to the messy and hilarious genre of music-centered
romance movies of the 2000s (*High School Musical* (2006) and *Camp
Rock* (2008) being the obvious examples of when the genre perfected
itself). Hilary Duff plays Terri Fletcher, a sixteen-year-old living in
Flagstaff, Arizona, who dreams of becoming a singer. The film takes a
dark turn when her brother Paul is killed in a car accident, after a
Three Days Grace concert. Terri's mother urges her to go to a music
conservatory on the West Coast over the summer, to follow her heart and
fulfil her late brother's dreams for her. Once there, Terri tastes her
first slice of reality outside of her small-town upbringing: mean girls,
cute boys, and a competitive music school. What follows is a heartfelt
story about family and first romance, replete with saccharine dialogue
about 'the transcendent power of music.'

## The Lizzie McGuire Movie

Usually the favourite of many Duff fans, *The Lizzie McGuire Movie*
(2003) follows the characters of the titular television show as they
embark on their graduation trip to Rome. What begins as an innocent
school trip full of pizza and piazzas swiftly turns into a whirlwind
journey for Lizzie, who is pursued by Italian pop star Paolo due to her
uncanny likeness to his singing partner Isabella. Lizzie is roped into
performing with him (and pretending to be Isabella) at the Italian Music
Awards, throwing her into the glittering world of fame. As the story
unfolds, however, we realise Paolo may not be exactly who we thought him
to be. The movie is beautifully chaotic in its nonsensical storyline,
overflowing with excitement, intrigue, and a phenomenal soundtrack which
I still listen to. We also finally (finally!) have romance between
Lizzie and Good Guy Gordo, and for that, I am eternally grateful.

## The Perfect Man

In my opinion, *The Perfect Man* is one of the Duff films that
unfortunately gets overshadowed by the rest, and is rarely lauded with
the praise it deserves. Set in Brooklyn, the film follows the lives of
single mother Jean (played brilliantly by Heather Locklear) and her two
daughters, Holly and Zoe. Sick of seeing her mother heartbroken over
another deadbeat man, Holly (Duff) decides to play matchmaker and set
her mother up with a fake 'secret admirer' named Ben, based off of her
friend's restaurateur uncle (played by Chris Noth of *Sex and the City* fame). As Holly struggles to keep the
secret of the matchmaking from her mother (with the help of artsy boy Adam played by Ben Feldman,
who I concede is a big reason why I love this film so much), we see mother and daughter
deal with the ups and downs of romantic life. The film pushes beyond its own fluttery
romcom scope to become a testament to both family and womanhood.
Soundtracked to some beautiful 2000s melodies (and containing possibly
the happiest moment in cinematic history: all three women dancing to
Kaci Battaglia's "I Will Learn to Love Again" in a living-room routine),
*The Perfect Man* is a perfect feel-good movie I find myself coming back
to more often than I would care to admit.

## A Cinderella Story

The last movie on my list is the 2004 cinematic triumph, *A Cinderella
Story*. Set in a drought-ridden San Fernando Valley, Duff plays Sam
Montgomery, a teenage girl who lives with her emotionally abusive
stepmother and stepsisters and works at her late father's diner after
school. The story is, of course, that of Cinderella, just with a few
more flip phones and low-rise jeans. As an escape from her tumultuous
home life, she finds refuge in an online pen pal 'Nomad', who is
secretly quarterback Austin Ames (played by none other than 2000s
heartthrob Chad Michael Murray). They finally meet at the Halloween
dance (where Austin is unable to recognise her because of a mask?)
before Sam rushes to get back to the diner by midnight. She accidentally
drops her cell phone while leaving the dance, thus prompting Austin to
find the identity of his mystery girl. The film explores ideas of
friendship, family, and identity in complex ways, showing Sam's real
support system to lie outside of her family, in her friends and
colleagues. While the romance between Austin and Sam is central to the
plot, the real narrative is that of Sam standing up for what she wants
in life, and learning to love who she is. *A Cinderella Story* is a spin
on a fairytale which prioritizes Sam's story: her growth comes not from
falling in love with Austin, but from recognising what she wants and
fighting for it. Apart from Duff's moving portrayal, we also get an
iconic rainy make-out scene at the end to a Jimmy Eat World song, so
what's not to like?

All in all, I think it's clear that Hilary Duff is responsible for much of the magic of mid-2000s teen movies, and helped fortify a specific genre of film that, although dated, remains endlessly entertaining (and loveable) even now.
