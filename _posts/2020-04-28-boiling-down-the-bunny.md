<p id="first-paragraph">The púca is a slippery creature. Dark and white furred, the emissary of
good and bad fortune, bearer of help and hindrance. Frequently appearing in the form
of a rabbit, the púca has been known to manifest, from Killarny to the Bay of Biscay, in
many guises. This creature from celtic folklore phas made several
appearances as a rabbit on the dreamscape of the silver screen. The púca
in Henry Koster's <i>Harvey</i> (1950), based on Mary Chase's play of the
same name, is the on-screen inception of the rabbit motif that audiences
have chased into 2020.</p>

The prevalence of rabbits in 2019 releases may have caught your
attention, with two notable appearances in Jordan Peele's *Us*, and Yorgos Lanthimos's *The
Favourite*. *Us* is a film dedicated to problematising the lines which
demarcate a world under-wrought with a subterranean class. The affinity between the
dual-sheared rabbit ears and double-Adelaide's weapon of choice, the scissors, is a testament to
the fertility of the rabbit as a symbol of duality and a creature of multiple worlds.

Seventeen rabbits feature in *The Favourite*, one for each child Queen
Anne (Olivia Coleman) has lost to infant mortality. Abigail (Emma Stone) is able to form a
bond with Anne through demonstrating affection for the rabbits, with Anne taking Abigail's
apparent fondness for the creatures as an implicit understanding of the gravity of the loss
they represent. Abigail yields to the fantasy of sustained maternity that the seventeen rabbits
offer, while Sarah (Rachel Weisz), Queen Anne's closest advisor and long-term lover is a
hunter by nature, and is exasperated by Anne's apparently delusional
attachment to the creatures. Eventually, Abigail reveals her scorn for
both Anne and her rabbits, pressing her heeled slipper onto the skull of
one with a delicacy which fails to conceal her delight in crushing
Anne's substitute child. The final shot of *The Favourite* features
Queen Anne bitterly forcing Abigail to sexually pleasure her, overlaid
with the ghostly trace of the remaining sixteen rabbits.

Perhaps the most famous rabbit in the western cultural imaginary is
Lewis Carrol's White Rabbit in the beloved *Alice in Wonderland*. The fluffy cottontail leads
Alice 'down the rabbit hole', but it is unclear whether Alice is running
from the onset of puberty, or towards the alluring mystery of the subterranean world. The rabbit hole emerges as
the portal to another dimension, wrought with the danger of uncertainty, or the
passage which leads to the dead-end warmth of the rabbit's warren, a site of refuge from the
complexity of the surface world. Carrol's White Rabbit runs through contemporary cinema,
traceable to the tattooed arm of Dujour in *The Matrix* (1999). Neo (Keanu Reeves) is
instructed to 'Follow the White Rabbit' down the first of a series of tunnels which penetrate
the nature of his reality.

When the rabbit features as a friend, the enfolding walls of the warren
are sought as a site of refuge rather than a portal to a fantasy dimension. In *The
Favourite*, Queen Anne's bed-chamber functions as a dually a public realm in which monarchical
theatrics are performed, and a sensual sanctuary accessed by her lovers
through a tunnel concealed beneath a tapestry. The rabbit-warren
presents as a site of refuge *and* a site of fantastic performance.
Because this warren marries refuge and fantasy, it intensifies the
danger of the outside-world. The comfort sought by Anne in her lovers is
blurred with the performance of court, and thus becomes personally and
politically destructive. In Peele's *Us*, descent through a tunnel leads
to a hellscape in which 'the tethered' play out a warped inversion of
life above. Poignantly, Adelaide's own childhood rabbit toy--minus
head--prompts her to follow her double to the inferno below. The rabbit
draws Adelaide to a place in which the lack of distinction between
reality and illusion, the above and the below is exposed.

Rabbits have a certain *breed-ability* as a horror motif, likely because
of the power differential they invoke. The body of the rabbit is a vessel of terror
-- portending our own vulnerability to terror, and the ease with which we slip into
enacting terror in the lives of others. Our heeled slipper, like Abigail, is poised and ready
to crush the quivering corpus of the rabbit. Peele's directorial debut, *Get Out* (2017) opens
with the World War Two pop tune 'Run Rabbit Run', introducing the rabbit
motif developed in *Us*, in which the creatures come to exhibit the
slippery distinction between terrorist and terrorised. The rabbit
figures further as an animal through which conflict is mediated in
Bartek Konopka\'s Oscar-nominated documentary *Rabbit à la Berlin*
(2009). Narrated from the point of view of a colony of wild rabbits
settled in the dead zone between East and West Berlin, the film
encourages consideration of the ambivalent consequences of the end of
the Cold War. Konopka's rabbits struggle to assimilate into their
environment post-fall, in parallel with citizens of East Berlin. The
expanses of grass afforded as a habitat for the colony by the dead zone
are developed, but the rabbits' habitat remains suspended.

The term for an obsessive lover -- 'bunny boiler' -- finds its origins
in Adrian Lyne's *Fatal Attraction* (1987). The now infamous sequence in
Lyne's psychological-thriller draws on the horror of what is and what
isn't to be found in two locations -- the empty rabbit-hutch, and the
lidded-pot sizzling on the stove. The state of suspense, the
anticipation of imminent destruction that the rabbit's twitching nose
and darting eyes betray, is a convenient embodiment for the dread which
good horror invokes in its audience.

Films such as *Night of the Lepus* (1972)*, Monty Python and the Holy
Grail* (1975), however, feature rabbits who wreak havoc on those who
would cast them merely as the passive recipients of terror. *Monty
Python*'s 'Rabbit of Caerbannog' would never find itself as the main
protein source in anyone's pot. These killer rabbits find their
fore-bearers as the antagonists of knights in the marginal illustrations
of Medieval manuscripts. Much speculation has surrounded the peculiar
appearances of the furry creatures as an accompaniment to tales of
Chivalric honour. What could be less noble than needing a full suit of
armour to contend with a rabbit? But marginalia often strikes a
discordant tone with the text it accompanies. Positing the rabbit as the
mortal enemy of man jibes at the value-systems which reward unsolicited
acts of violence with honour.

While they say that dogs are man's best friend, rabbits are more often
cast in this role on screen -- in spite of their homicidal tendencies.
Rabbits have featured as cinematic companions in films as diverse as
*Donnie Darko* (2001), *The Favourite* and *Harvey*. The late Memed
Aksoy's short-film *Panfilo* (2014) centres on the narrative of a young
boy who insists on parity of treatment with his imaginary best friend, a
rabbit he calls Panfilo. Aksoy's protagonist is able to advocate the
physical well-being of Panfilo as a substitute for expressing his own
emotional needs to his recently widowed father. In each of the films
listed above, rabbits tend to favour the friendship of individuals who
linger on social fringes, otherwise estranged from normative kinship
structures. Donnie of *Donnie Darko* (a source of inspiration for a
generation of softbois) is the archetypal outsider wont to be befriended
by the rabbit.

The surplus of rabbits in 2019 releases may be attributable to a
heightened state of uncertainty about the future. But when isn't there a
heightened state of uncertainty about the future? The rabbit seems a
helpful reminder of the interminable fertility of life amidst chaos and
destruction. The rabbit is both púca and innocuous household pet, an
opportunity to face and laugh at our fears of mortality. Ceding to his
personal púca (the titular 6'3.5" rabbit, Harvey) as a guide provides
Elwood P. Dowd with the opportunity to relinquish the rigid unkindness
of 20th century society in favour of a fantasy world of interminable
generosity. In the end, his sister is struck by a reluctance to lose the
Elwood who always puts the needs of others before his own -- even to the
extremes of social recklessness -- when she misplaces her coin purse.
She is prompted to rescind the command for Elwood to submit to
experimental psychiatric treatment promised to 'shock him' back to
reality upon the realisation that only Harvey can be relied on to pay
her tabs. Smiling, Elwood announces to sanatorium proprietor, Dr
Chumley, 'I've wrestled with reality for 35 years, and I'm happy to
state I've finally won out over it'.

Sur, sub, and para-terranean: rabbits challenge our ability to
distinguish between that which is buried, and that which is on the
surface. If the term 'liminal' hadn't been emptied of meaning through
overuse, I'd perhaps here conclude that rabbits are liminal creatures,
the zombies of the animal kingdom. Instead I'll end with the truism that
from Medieval killer rabbits to Peele's *Us*, the rabbit offers us the
chance to 'win out over reality', if we dare submit to their unnerving
power to lead us into their tunnels, with no end in sight.
