<p id="first-paragraph">Everyone and I mean everyone, has a favourite cartoon. As children, these short form animated shows are handed to us in plenty as parents seek a moment of respite. But why keep them for the kids? Here are five cartoons, for both kids and adult, that will help you dive back into the creative colourful world of animation.</p>

## 1\. Over the Garden Wall

Cartoon Network's 2014 mini-series Over the Garden Wall is a visual
spectacle, with every frame worthy of a gallery. Following half brothers Wirt
(Elijah Woods) and Greg (Collin Dean) as they find themselves lost in the Unknown and
unknowingly hunted by The Beast, the show is the perfect blend of childish fun and uncanny
explorations more appreciated by older audiences. Much like the forest of the Unknown
itself, which stands beautifully in the height of autumn, the show turns from kitsch to creepy in a heartbeat.

## 2\. Tuca and Bertie

We all know of the much-too relatable Bojack Horseman, but from the same producers comes Tuca and Bertie, an adult animated series that similarly
looks at deeper ideas through the colourful and zany characters and style. The show
focuses on titular best-friends Tuca and Bertie as they live their lives in the bustling
city of Bird Town; the two finding absolute joy in their friendship despite their differences in character. Think Girls as a well-done buddy comedy, but with a toucan and a thrush.

## 3\. Avatar: The Legend of Korra (many watched the first)

It's not a stretch to say that many of us watched Nickelodeon's Avatar:
The Last Airbender growing up. The Legend of Korra is the fantastic follow-up to
the series that not only recreates the feel of its predecessor but expands on its world in
fascinating ways. The new Avatar, Korra, has to learn how to deal with the political and
spiritual unrest that comes with a new modernising world. What's more, this show has
everything: gorgeous fight sequences, well-developed characters, and both humour and emotion aplenty.

## 4\. Archer

This spy satire is one that's well deserved of it's long number of
seasons --- it's eleventh scheduled to be released this year. An all-out comedy, Archer
follows master spy Sterling Archer and the dysfunctional 'International Secret Intelligence
Service' he works for. Grounded primarily by it's quick-witted dialogue and use of
self-referential humous, the show isn't afraid to be silly, instead going as far out-there as
possible to get a good laugh. Though you may find yourself enjoying the later anthology seasons
more than others, Archer is downright brilliant and bizarre.

## 5\. She-Ra and the Princesses of Power

Don't be fooled by the glittery pastel visuals of this Netflix original,
underneath and alongside it is a show that looks at friendship, family, and war.
Following She-Ra and her team coming up against foe and friend to take down oppressive empire,
The Horde, this show is the perfect blend of serious and fun. No matter what you're in
the mood for, She- Ra will have it. Characters are multidimensional and the narrative
develops at a good pace, revealing layers of interest that give the show a real sense of
depth.
