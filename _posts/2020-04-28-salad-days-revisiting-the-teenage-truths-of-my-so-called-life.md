<p id="first-paragraph">2019 churned out teen television hits. Netflix's <i>Sex Education</i> came
out in January. <i>Euphoria</i> was aptly premiered in the summer. The third
season of <i>13 Reasons Why</i> was released in August, if anyone was still
watching. Social media like Twitter and Instagram have been the perfect
catalysts for the popularity of these shows. As I binge-watched the
second season of <i>Sex Education</i> earlier this year, I found myself using
it as a reflective exercise towards my own teen experience. Chatting
with friends, I wasn't alone in wishing we had "something like that"
when we were in high school -- a show that could model and explore
relationships and sex in a healthy, useful, and fairly realistic way. In
a sense, <i>Euphoria</i> represents the other end of the spectrum with teen
television: a fantasy of shimmery, sexy bodies, drugs, and partying,
evoking the messier, more shocking approach to adolescence introduced by
classics like <i>Skins</i>. Upon further reflection, I realised that as a
teenager I <i>had</i> also watched shows that felt realistic and empathetic
-- I just haven't thought about them in a while.</p>

*My So-Called Life* (1994-1995) ran for a single season before its
tragic cancellation. Starring a young teenage Claire Danes as Angela
Chase, it explores changing friendships, intense crushes, and domestic
dynamics with a dream-like eye. In the pilot, Angela and her new, more
rebellious friends wait in the parking lot of a nightclub for a
connection to get them inside, passing around a bottle of liquor. As
Rickie (Wilson Cruz) paces impatiently back and forth, Rayanne (A. J.
Langer) asks him, "Haven't you ever waited for anything?" The immediate
sassy response: "Yeah, for my life to start." The conversation quickly
moves on, but that line lingered in my head. I wondered if it had also
lingered back when I first watched the show at sixteen, or if it is only
in looking back at my adolescence -- knowing what I know now -- that I'm
able to relate so acutely on behalf of my younger self. My time in high
school was largely spent hormonal, angsty, and anxious. I didn't exactly
act out on these feelings, but internally I was deeply disturbed by this
phase in my life over which I seemed to have no control. I daydreamed
about other realities and about a future where I could bring these
daydreams to life. TV was a great escape, but *My So-Called Life* offers
more than simple entertainment \-- it seems to accurately express the
fog of the teenage experience. People, and the way they act, are
confusing; places lack clarity, and you can't necessarily see more than
two steps ahead of you, if it's even the right direction. Rewatching it
now, my brain keeps going off like a buzzer: *Yes!* *I felt like that!*

The teen-oriented 'high school show' has now become a television staple
in the 21st century. The phenomenon is visually sprinkled with familiar
signifiers -- school hallways lined with lockers, a cafeteria divided
into cliques and tribes, bathrooms of both sanctuary and terror, family
homes packed with discord and harmony\... While the genre is rife with
cliches and stereotypes, it will remain eternally relevant as long as
adolescents continue to exist. In the 1990s, shows like *90210*, *My
So-Called Life*, and *Freaks and Geeks,* among many others, paved the
way for the teen TV show as we know it, expanding the category from the
condescending realm of the afterschool special to a diverse landscape of
series looking to meaningfully explore this disorienting time of life.

Artistic access to those sensitive years between the ages of around
thirteen to eighteen, encompassed by or overlapping with the final
stages of schooling in most countries, has only recently been granted.
'Adolescence' itself is a largely modern concept which started to form
in the 1920s, gathering steam with the popularisation of mass secondary
education three decades later. Psychologists, physicians, parents, and
educators of the mid 20th century onwards have been gripped and
perplexed by the angst and unpredictability of 'teenagers' ever
since.[^1] At least in the United States, whose media pioneered teen
television and pop culture, the 1950s permitted adolescents greater
autonomy and expression than ever before. They became a consumer
audience the film and television industry was soon eager to cater to,
but it was only in the late 80s and 90s that the media took teenagers on
screen more seriously.

Part of the beauty of *My So-Called Life* lies within its often
inconclusive, meandering plotlines. Bits and pieces of characters\'
lives are fed to us from the beginning, but instead of rising loudly to
the foreground for a couple of episodes in typical soap drama style,
these strands feed in and out of the story, similar to real life
experience. Rayanne's strained relationship with her mother -- a single
parent who often acts more like a best friend -- is one of these ongoing
storylines. Angela's own home life, a seemingly stable image of
middle-class domesticity, comes with its own complexities as the show
explores not only the teenager's relationship with her parents, but
their relationship to each other as they grapple with infidelity. Though
much of the action develops in and around the high school, *My So-Called
Life* truly blossoms within the Chase household. Angela's parents,
Graham (Tom Irwin) and Patty (Bess Armstrong), grapple with their
emerging 'good cop'/'bad cop' roles. As their daughter changes and
challenges them directly and indirectly, they change and challenge
themselves. In my rewatching, the accurate depiction of those quite
painful relationship dynamics reminded me of *Lady Bird* (2017)*.* Both
Gerwig and the MSCL writers struck gold when digging in the murkiness of
parenting an adolescent.

But when it comes to exploring home situations, Rickie's character and
his storyline sensitively delve into territory rarely explored on TV at
the time. Until episode 19, when he finally states, "I'm gay. I've never
said it before out loud," Rickie's sexuality is kept vague. Though
frequently roughed up at school and comfortable following Angela and
Rayanne into the girls' bathrooms, where he reapplies his eyeliner and
adjusts his colourful shirts, Rickie isn't written as a two-dimensional
'gay best friend'. He's shown to be deeply sensitive -- "I really like
that," he says slowly and softly, heavy gaze on Angela, when she shares
the sentence she'd want to hear before having sex: "You're so beautiful,
it hurts to look at you." Rickie longs for love and a change of
circumstances. Things change for the worse in episode 15, when he's
kicked out of the house he lives in with his abusive uncle and spends
Christmas on the streets. This episode has stuck with me the longest,
spotlighting the alienating, anonymous experience of LGBTQ adolescent
homelessness with overwhelming tenderness. Rickie's ethnicity is never
explicitly handled, but his specifically intersectional identity and
visibility as a queer, afro-latinx youth on-screen is ground-breaking
representation for early shows of the kind.

It's hard to put my finger on exactly *when* and *why* shows like *My
So-Called Life* are so effective. I watched it almost a decade after it
first came out, my adolescent, noughties gaze infused with the idea that
anything 90s was for the cool kids. Watching it again now it still holds
up strong in a different way. Will these things always be clearer in
retrospect? It *was* written by adults, so perhaps an adult mind is
required to see through the fog and appreciate what's being done. Maybe
there's a double effect in *My So-Called Life*, where it unfolds
different layers of magic as both the show and the viewer age; there is
something there for everybody who is or has been a teenager.

As an adolescent viewer, I couldn't discern how accurately written the
adolescence on screen was. It was just like looking in a mirror; I
related to Angela as a peer. The way Angela's mind works is expressed in
her voiceover over almost every episode. She's the sole observer of the
world, her thoughts like slow, private musings she probably feels are
exclusive to her \-- something we can all remember feeling. This has an
intimate effect, playfully building an immediate personal relationship
with the viewer and killing any potential condescension, enemy of all
teenagers.

*My So-Called Life* and similar shows that followed strive for
authenticity and succeed. By tapping into a wide range of universal
experiences through various archetypes, such television is relevant to
different kinds of teenage viewers united by that one experience that
can't be controlled: adolescence. The intensity of that life stage will
continue to be picked apart and examined in different ways on-screen, be
it in the neon pinks and purples of *Euphoria* or the soft pastels of
*Sex Education*. There are infinite avenues to explore -- shows like *My
So-Called Life* opened these up by breaking down the constructed
barriers between the teenage bubble and the wider world that suspends
it.
